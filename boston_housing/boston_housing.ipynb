    "Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported."

    "### Question 1 - Feature Observation\n",
    "As a reminder, we are using three features from the Boston housing dataset: `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, and `'PTRATIO'`. For each data point (neighborhood):\n",
    "- `'RM'` is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.\n",
    "- `'LSTAT'` is the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered \"lower class\" (working poor).\n",
    "- `'PTRATIO'` is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** Using your intuition, for each of the three features above, do you think that an increase in the value of that feature would lead to an **increase** in the value of `'MEDV'` or a **decrease** in the value of `'MEDV'`? Justify your answer for each.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** This problem can phrased using examples like below.  \n",
    "* Would you expect a home that has an `'RM'` value(number of rooms) of 6 be worth more or less than a home that has an `'RM'` value of 7?\n",
    "* Would you expect a neighborhood that has an `'LSTAT'` value(percent of lower class workers) of 15 have home prices be worth more or less than a neighborhood that has an `'LSTAT'` value of 20?\n",
    "* Would you expect a neighborhood that has an `'PTRATIO'` value(ratio of students to teachers) of 10 have home prices be worth more or less than a neighborhood that has an `'PTRATIO'` value of 15?"

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "1. 6 'RM' vs 7 'RM'\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In general, an increase in 'RM' will lead to an increase in home price.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Assuming all things are equal, a home with many rooms tends to mean a bigger home, more   square feet tends to equal a larger property and a higher 'MEDV'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Depending on the market, if there is a glut in homes with 7 'RM' this may cause a decline in 'MEDV'in the short term and an increase in 'MEDV' for 6 'RM' in the long run, ceteris paribus.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A home in an area with a higher 'LSTAT' and a 7 'RM' may cost less than a home with a 6 'RM' in an area with a low 'LSTAT'\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 'LSTAT' of 15 Vs 20\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Neighborhoods with high 'LSTAT' tend to be areas with higher 'MEDV'.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If we assume a neighborhood that has a 'LSTAT' of 15, and another has an 'LSTAT' of 20, the neighborhood with a 15 will by definition have a higher 'MEDV' given people are willing to pay a premium for living in an area with less \"Low class workers\". (Aint that a B?)\n",
