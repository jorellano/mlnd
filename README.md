#MLND
===========

[Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) project files and notes

The Nanodegree is an online certification which involves the following

	1. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning and Reinforcement learning, and Deep Learning

	2. The MLND involves 6 projects (p0-p5 ), 5 of which are core to the degree.
	
	
	

## Program Outline:
=====================

	0. Exploratory Project: Titanic Survival Exploration
	
	1. Model Evaluation and Validation
	..* Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
		
	2. upervised Learning
	..* Project 2: Building a Student Intervention System (Predicting whether or not students will fail so schools can intervene to help them graduate)
		
	3. Unsupervised Learning
	..* Project 3: Creating Customer Segments (Segmenting customers based on spending in different categories)
		
	4. Reinforcement Learning
